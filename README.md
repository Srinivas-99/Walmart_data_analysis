## About Walmart:
  Walmart, founded in 1962 by Sam Walton, is a retail giant and one of the world's largest and most influential companies. Headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, this American multinational corporation has established itself as a global powerhouse in the retail industry. Walmart operates a vast network of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores under various brand names across the United States and in numerous countries around the world. Known for its "Everyday Low Prices" strategy, Walmart has redefined the retail landscape with its commitment to offering a wide range of products at affordable prices. With its extensive supply chain and efficient distribution systems, the company has played a pivotal role in shaping consumer expectations and shopping habits. Beyond retail, Walmart has also ventured into e-commerce, technology innovation, and sustainability initiatives, further solidifying its position as a key player in the modern retail ecosystem.
## Business Problem: 
  The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyse the customer purchase behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are male and 50 million are female.)
## Recommendations:
1. ### Target Male Shoppers:
Since male customers account for a significant portion of Black Friday sales and tend to spend more per transaction on average, Walmart should tailor its marketing strategies and
product offerings to incentivise higher spending among male customers while ensuring competitive pricing for female-oriented products.
2. Focus on the 26 - 45 Age Group:
  - With the age group between 26 and 45 contributing to the majority of sales, Walmart should specifically cater to the preferences and needs of this demographic. This could include offering exclusive deals on products that are popular among this age group.
3. Engage Younger Shoppers:
  - Knowing that customers in the 0 - 17 age group have the lowest spending per transaction, Walmart can try to increase their spending per transaction by offering them more attractive discounts, coupons, or rewards programs. It's essential to start building brand loyalty among younger consumers.
4. Customer Segmentation:
  - Since customers in the 18 - 25, 26 - 35, and 46 - 50 age groups exhibit similar buying characteristics, and so do the customers in 36 - 45 and 55+, Walmart can optimise its product selection to cater to the preferences of these age groups. Additionally, Walmart can utilise this information to adjust its pricing strategies for various age groups.
5. Enhance the 51 - 55 Age Group Shopping Experience:
  - Considering that customers aged 51 - 55 have the highest spending per transaction, Walmart offer them exclusive pre-sale access, special discounts or provides personalised product recommendations for this age group. Walmart can also introduce loyalty programs specifically designed to reward and retain customers in the 51 - 55 age group.
6. Post-Black Friday Engagement:
  - After Black Friday, Walmart should engage with customers who made purchases by sending follow-up emails or offers for related products. This can help increase customer retention and encourage repeat business throughout the holiday season and beyond.
